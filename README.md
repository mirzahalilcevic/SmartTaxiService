# Smart Taxi Service

A project made for the 2018 Bicom Systems Hackathon at which it won 2nd place. The solution uses a network server to pair clients with nearby taxi vehicles. The server is built using the [C++ Actor Framework](https://github.com/actor-framework/actor-framework) and [Boost.SML](https://github.com/boost-ext/sml), and this repository contains its source.
